# Hi there, I'm Samuel Snow

Welcome to my GitHub space — where raw data transforms into clear insights and powerful stories.

I’m a Data Analyst with a passion for turning numbers into knowledge. Whether it's a messy dataset or a complex business problem, I love diving deep, cleaning the chaos, and delivering actionable insights that actually make sense.

## What I Do
Explore Data:  Because every dataset has a story to tell  
Clean Data:  Messy data? That’s my playground  
Visualize Insights: I make data speak in charts, graphs, and dashboards  
Tell Data Stories: Insights that matter, not just numbers on a page

## Tools in My Kit
Tool / What I Use It For 
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
SQL: Querying and data wrangling 
Excel: Fast analysis and dashboards 
Power BI: Clean, interactive dashboards 
Git & GitHub: Version control and sharing projects
